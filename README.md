# Common Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch
This repository contains some common machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch in Python. This is done as a learning exercise and the complexity will increase as more algorithms are added. I'll add some brief notes on the mathematics (e.g. main gist of the algorithm and derivations of gradient updates) as and when I have time to write them up. 

Algorithms covered so far:
- Linear regression,
- Logistic Regression.
